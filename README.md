# WishE
Crowdsourced greeting card searching and art

Hacked together for some user testing. Has lots of TODO's :
- Need to switch to MongoDB DBrefs. Currently lots of duplicated data. 
- Need to Normalize schemas.
- Need to get GridFS up for image storage
- Need to comment
- Should change to SQL (lots of relational data)
- Should namespace components and collections (too many globals)
- Should use publishes and methods
- Should refactor Lists to make into reusable code.
- Should make prettier. Not important for now
